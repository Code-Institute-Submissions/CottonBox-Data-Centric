### Wireframes

The wireframes for the project can be found [here](docs/wireframes.pdf).

## Features

For each feature, I have made the commits on a separate branch in order to maintain the stability of the `development` branch.

### Existing Features

#### 1. Navigation

I have created a responsive navigation which collapses when viewed on smaller devices such as tablets and phone.

##### 1.1 Categories Dropdown Menu

I have created a dropdown menu for the available categories by iterating through the categories collection and displaying the name.

I have created links to the `about` and `contact` pages respectively.

##### 1.3 Language Selection Dropdown Menu

I have created a dropdown menu for the available langauges by iterating through the languages collection and displaying the name.

> Currently the links do not work as I have not implemented the different language versions of the site.

##### 1.4 Shopping Cart Link

##### 1.5 Search Bar

I have created a search bar where users are able to search for products which redirect them to the `search results` page when they press enter.

> Currently the link does not work as I have not implemented the search function or the `search results` page.

#### 2. Callout Section

I have created a callout section that is dismissible by the user so that screen space can be regained.

The callout will also remain dismissed once already dismissed and the page is reloaded.

##### 2.1 Callout Close Button

When this button is clicked by the user, it triggers a jQuery function which sets a cookie. If the page is reloaded, the page will check to see if the cookie has been set, if so then the callout will not be displayed.

It also provides the user with information to contact the company as well as social media links to the company's pages.

#### 7. category Page

The `category` page allows the user to view all available products from the specified category.

> Currently the product per page and pagination section of the `category` page are not implemented as there are not enough products in order to warrant the implementation. Once there are more products, then they will be implemented.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
  - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
